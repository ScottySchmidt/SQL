Symmetric Pairs:  https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/symmetric-pairs/problem?isFullScreen=true
Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.
Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X. List the rows such that X1 â‰¤ Y1.
Specifically, the line: HAVING COUNT(*)>1 OR a.X!=a.Y
This above code will find a pair that is a duplicate. 
But then distinct will only count this pair once.
The or statement is needed because typically a sym pair are not the same x is less than y.
-----------------

This problem requires a large amount of thinking and trying to resolve it is challenging

SELECT DISTINCT a.*
FROM functions a
INNER JOIN Functions b ON (a.X=b.Y AND a.Y=b.X)
WHERE a.X <= a.Y
GROUP BY a.X, a.Y
HAVING COUNT(*)>1 OR a.X!=a.Y
ORDER BY a.X
;
