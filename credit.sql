Your company has an internal policy to determine your customers' credit limit, 
but this procedure has been questioned recently by the board as being too conservative.

Your CEO wants to increase the current customer base credit limits in order to upsell a new line of products. 
In order to do that, the company hired several external consultancies to produce new credit limit estimates.

The problem is that each agency has produced the report in its own format. 
Some use the format "First-name Last-name" to identify a person, others use the format "Last-name, First-name". There is also no consensus on how to capitalize each word, so some used all uppercase, others used all lowercase, and some used mixed-case.

Also, some names are titled, for example: "Dr. Hannibal Lecter", "Robert Downey Jr." etc. 
you will need to pay attention to any such or similar cases.
