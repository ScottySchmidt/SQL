Pivot the Occupation column in OCCUPATIONS so that each Name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding Occupation. 
The output column headers should be Doctor, Professor, Singer, and Actor, respectively.
Note: Print NULL when there are no more names corresponding to an occupation.

Need more pratice with pivot tables had to do lots of research and did not use the pivot way.
Will attempt this problem again shortly as pivot tables are very pracatical. 

Notes:
1. Must use max (or min) since there is a groupby clause. 
2. Using the pivot way is more useful instead of using hundreds of potential case statements that could change.
-----------------

SELECT 
max(CASE WHEN occupation='Doctor' THEN name END),
max(CASE WHEN occupation='Professor' THEN name END),
max(CASE WHEN occupation='Singer' THEN name END),
max(CASE WHEN occupation='Actor' THEN name END)

FROM (SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY occupation ORDER BY name) as rn
      FROM occupations
     ) t
     
GROUP BY rn
