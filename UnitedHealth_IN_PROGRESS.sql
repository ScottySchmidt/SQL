Patient Analysis [UnitedHealth SQL Interview Question]

UnitedHealth Group has a program called Advocate4Me,
which allows members to call an advocate and receive support for their health care needs 
â€“ whether that's behavioural, clinical, well-being, health care financing, benefits, claims or pharmacy help.
Write a query to get the patients who made a call within 7 days of their previous call. 
If a patient called more than twice in a span of 7 days, count them as once.

Use of Lag likely required which is what I assumed:

with policies as (
SELECT policy_holder_id, call_received,
LAG (call_received) OVER (
PARTITION BY policy_holder_id
ORDER BY policy_holder_id DESC, call_received
) prev_date
FROM callers
) 

SELECT * FROM policies
---where call_received > dateadd(dd, 7, prev_date)
;
